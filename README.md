Hi, this a sample of my work.   

1. Capstone_draft-Copy1 - In this project I look at the 2017 Boston Marathon dataset from Kaggle.  I use EDA and statistics to answer the following questions:
  -Which country brought the fastest runners?
  -Do male runners run faster than female runners?
  -How do marathon times change with age?
  
2. Supervised_Learning_UFC_fight_predictions - I built some models to see how they would do predicting fights.  I wanted to see I can improve on the current UFC model.  

3.  Untitled8 - In this project I use unsupervised learning and anomaly detection to see if I can predict credit card fraud.
