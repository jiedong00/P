Hi, thanks for stopping by!  This is a sample of my projects.   

1. Unsupervised fraud(Analmaly) Detection - 'Untitled8' - In this project I use ideas unsupervised learning and anomaly detection to see if I can predict credit card fraud.  I used to non-linear dimensionality reduction to simplify the problem and map all the data from higher dimensions down to a one dimensional subspace call anomaly score.  Then in this lower dimension the decision is made.        
  
2. UFC Fight Predictions - 'Supervised_Learning_UFC_fight_predictions' - I build some supervised models and see how they do at predicting UFC fights.  I wanted to see I can improve on the current UFC model.  During cross valiation, my best model was 9% better than the current UFC model.    

4. senior_seminar2_heat_equation_final_version.pdf - This is a project I worked on senior year where I used the Heat Equations to model runaway exothermic reactions. Since the equation used does not have a closed from, it was solved using numerical methods with help from computers.  

5. Boston Marathon EDA(Capstone_draft-Copy1) - In this project I look at the 2017 Boston Marathon dataset from Kaggle.  I use EDA and statistics to answer the following questions:
  -Which country brought the fastest runners?
  -Do male runners run faster than female runners?
  -How do marathon times change with age?
